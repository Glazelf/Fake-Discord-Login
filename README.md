# Fake-Discord-Login
An educational extract of the Discord login page, edited slightly to warn people of phishing.  
This repository is a commission for an educational webinar.  
Input sent through the "login form" is sent to a Google Sheet. This Google Sheet is private to avoid trolling.  
  
It also has taught me a lot about data storage and usage on a static webpage as well as how bad Google App Script error messages are.  
This approach to data storage allows me to read and write data to and from a "database" (Google Sheet) fairly dynamically on a static site.  
I don't think this is realistic for any sort of production mostly due to the sheer amount of requests this would take to operate a database.
